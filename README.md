 **NOTE:** The CoreNEURON is now [integrated within NEURON](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn/tree/master/src/coreneuron) simulator at the source level and hence all the latest development happens under the main GitHub project [neuronsimulator/nrn](https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn). To use CoreNEURON, see the latest NEURON documentation under [nrn.readthedocs.io](https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).:bangbang:
